## A helping hand outside the kitchen



### Motivation

Between online recipe sites, instructional videos on YouTube, and the ubiquitous Tasty content cluttering our Facebook feeds, the internet has made it easier than ever to learn about cooking. But in spite of all the information available about what to do in the kitchen, an online culinary education fails to teach amateur cooks to navigate their local grocery store. While I consider myself fairly competent at a stove, I’ve often found myself woefully unprepared to overcome choice paralysis in the produce aisle.

Furthermore, in a place like our humble Williamstown, MA, many of the ingredients in recipes dreamed up by chefs in cities simply aren’t available. There ought to be a platform which helps people to understand and utilize their local ingredients to the fullest.


### Analysis

There are a number of factors to consider when purchasing produce:

* How do I tell if this is ripe?
* Is this fruit or vegetable in season?
* Does it grow in my region? Local vegetables will invariably be fresher and therefore more desirable.
* And of course, What can I make with this?

The idea behind Sous Shopper is to help keep track of information relating to the quality of produce, while encouraging its users to be creative in their application of the légume. Users will be able to view recipes from other users living in similar areas and submit their own as well. In addition to guiding cooks in the selection of their ingredients, it will also facilitate the exchange of information between community members.


### Possible Extensions

Although I believe in not overloading apps at the cost of usability, some additional functionality that would be interesting to explore on the topic of grocery shopping is a planner which would help users plan their meals over the course of a week. One of the greatest difficulties I encounter while grocery shopping is ensuring I don’t over-buy (creating waste) or under-buy (leaving me hungry). The app could help its users ensure they have the correct number of portions for the week, and let them know about the shelf life of their ingredients.


### Improvements on Current Systems

There are services such as Blue Apron which let people avoid the difficulties of grocery shopping by sending its users predetermined ingredients and an accompanying recipe. By removing the user’s choice, services such as these create dependency in the user, and ultimately teaches them very little about cooking. I believe that most people would prefer to be self-sufficient, they just don’t know where to start. Sous Shopper aims to actually educate its users about picking their own ingredients; to take control of the cooking process from start to finish, and make something they can be proud of.
