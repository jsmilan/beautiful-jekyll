# Good Design

It's rare that I get to discuss good design in the context of Williams College.
This is of course impacted by the fact that it is much easier to notice bad design
than good design -- I'm more likely to complain about obstacles than to acknowledge
the elements of campus that are perfectly serviceable. Nevertheless, I find myself
encountering a significant number of impediments at this school, usually erected
in the name of aesthetics. Take for example our beautiful but maddeningly inaccessible
administrative building, Hopkins Hall, or Sawyer quad's expensive but useless marble blocks.
Likewise, Williams' revamped website is very aesthetically pleasing, but makes accessing
some information, such as the course catalog, unnecessarily difficult.

But as much as I like to complain about this school, there is very little I can
find wrong with the website for WCMA. As a museum website, it is imperative that
it emphasizes aesthetics, yet it does not compromise on clarity of information.
In fact, the aesthetic of wcma.williams.edu assists in presenting the information
about WCMA.

The search bar at the top of the site doubles as a news ticker for the website,
but the search bar's primary function is still made obvious by its shape, positioning
and the magnifying glass button to its left. At the bottom, there is a scrolling
bar that shows all of the current exhibits at the museum in little rounded rectangles
that indicate the name of the exhibit and the how long it will be up. Hovering
over one of these rectangles will cause the rest of the overlay to disappear and
the background image to change to one of the representative works in that exhibit.

Clicking on the rectangle will bring you to the page for the exhibit, which contains
images of more works in the exhibit, as well as information about the artist and the
pieces on display.

I consider this good design because it is not only beautiful, but it encourages
exploration. Rather than organizing WCMA's exhibits as items in a dropdown menu,
this website prominently displays WCMA's contents, which immediately generates
interest in the works. Furthermore, all of the buttons on this site possess a certain
innate "clickability" that spurs the user on in their quest for information. The
website has a beautifully simple design philosophy: it shows the user something
interesting, and when they click in search of more information, it gives them
exactly what they want.
