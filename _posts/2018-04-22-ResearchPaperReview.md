For this assignment, I read [*The design of personal mobile technologies for lifelong learning*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131599000445) by Mike Sharples. This paper examines how handheld and wearable technologies can be leveraged as platforms for educational tools. Sharples asserts that the core characteristics of mobile apps aimed at promoting lifetime learning are that they must be:

* Highly portable
* Individual
* Unobtrusive
* Available
* Adaptable
* Persistent
* Useful
* Intuitive

This provides a framework by which to evaluate how well our app is taking advantage of its medium, so to speak. This paper also got me thinking of how useful our app is from a didactic perspective, not just as a reference tool.

Sharples outlines several roles that a Handheld Learning Resource (HandLeR) can play with its users. A HandLeR can simply function as a repository of tools and resources, as our app is currently laid out, but it also can substitute itself as a sort of teacher. The teacher approach is not so relevant for nutrition education or the broader theme of “learning in the wild,” but our HandLeR could potentially occupy an intermediate role as a mentor or assistant. While a library allows for the pursuit of lifetime learning, it doesn’t necessarily do anything to encourage it. An interesting approach to take in our app would be to study how to more actively involve ourselves in the user’s nutrition education without being obtrusive.
