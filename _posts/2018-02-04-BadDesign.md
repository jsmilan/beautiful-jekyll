# Bad Design

Forgive me if this post is redundant (I suspect many others will write on the same topic), but the failures of the website I am about to discuss are weighing heavily on my conscience. 
It is a site that lives in infamy on the Williams college campus: sarah.williams.edu, also known as the PeopleSoft website. 

![Peoplesoft Login](https://github.com/jsmilan/jsmilan.github.io/blob/master/img/Peoplesoft%20Login.PNG "The deceptively inviting PeopleSoft login screen, waiting to ensnare unsuspecting students")

This primary website used by students for all their Williams needs. 
Its functionality includes managing class enrollment, requesting progress reports, booking tickets for school charter buses and more. 
As long as one is enrolled at Williams, PeopleSoft is unavoidable, and this makes the evils of its design incredibly noticeable.

### A Rough Start

![Intermediate Menu](https://github.com/jsmilan/jsmilan.github.io/blob/master/img/Menu%20That%20Exists%20For%20No%20Reason%20(commentary).png "Where the frustration begins")

Upon logging in, the user is greeted by an awkward menu that has two square items in the upper left corner (Navigation Help and Main Menu) and plenty of negative space.
Because the site is in english, it's safe to assume that user will be reading the site visually from left to right.
This makes the placement of the menu items incredibly frustrating. On multiple occasions, I have double-clicked on "Navigation Help" in a hurry to access the main menu and proceed with my business.
Doing so causes an instructional pdf to launch in a new tab, further disorienting the user.

But by far the most frustrating element of this page is that it has absolutely no reason to exist. 
It provides the user with two options: 

1. Proceed to the main menu
2. Help the user access the main menu

Surely the problem here is evident. The user would be much better served by simply being directed to the main menu from the beginning! 
Think of all the precious seconds wasted by these needless intermediate menu. 
Consider all the erosion to students' delicate self-esteems caused by carelessly clicking on a frankly condescending help page.

Does this intermediate menu undermine the very credibility of Williams College as an institution? Perhaps not. But the fact remains, it would be so very easy to do better.
